Rockchip RK618 display bridge bindings
======================================

LVDS Encoder
------------

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following:
   "rockchip,rk618-lvds"
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
	  clock-names property.
	  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
	       property. Must contain "lvds", "dither", "vif", "scaler".

The LVDS has two video ports. Their connections are modeled using the OF
graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for DPI input
- Video port 1 for LVDS output
